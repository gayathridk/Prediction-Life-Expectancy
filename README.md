# Prediction-Life-Expectancy

•	The objective of the project is to predict the Life Expectancy by country across all the countries in the world using Multiple Linear Regression. 

•	This would help countries take critical decisions for their population based on the Life Expectancy. Life Expectancy prediction would be a factor to distinguish countries for      their overall welfare and economic growth. Through this project, the impact of different factors on the Life Expectancy and the correlation between them would be studied.

•	The most significant predictors that influence the Life Expectancy would be identified. Also, analysis of Life Expectancy by Continent would be performed to get a bigger           picture of the problem.
